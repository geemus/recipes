## Popovers

12 = 45 minutes

* 300g eggs
* 300g milk
* 300g bread flour
* 12g kosher salt
* grapeseed oil, as needed (or other oil, minding smoke point: such as clarified butter, ghee, duck fat, leaf lard, peanut oil, or butter)

 1. Gather ingredients, ensure eggs and milk are at room temperature.
 2. Put oven rack in second slot from the bottom and preheat to 450F.
 3. Whisk eggs until fluffy and double in volume. (or use blender instead of whisking, following same steps).
 4. Whisk in milk and salt.
 5. Sift in flour and use silicon spatula to stir everything gently together. (if blending, keep it on low speed to avoid over mixing)
 6. Rest batter at room temperature for 1 hour, or in the refrigerator overnight (pulling out 2 hours before baking, or using lukewarm bath to get to room temperature)
 7. Pour oil into 3 cavities closest to non dominant hand until ~2/3 full.
 8. Tilt pan and let oil run down to other cavities, filling evenly.
 9. Place on half-sheet tray to catch spills and place in oven to preheat for 10-20 minutes.
10. Remove pan from oven and quickly pour batter into each cavity until almost full, use a spoon to catch drips between cavities.
11. Once filled, return to oven and bake until puffed high and golden brown all around, about 20 minutes.
12. Remove pan from oven and let cool for a few moments before removing from pan.

Smart Oven? Convection at 450F. Baking pan on position 8. Bake 20 minutes.
