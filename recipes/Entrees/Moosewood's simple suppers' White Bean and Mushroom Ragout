1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups finely chopped onions

Directions:
On medium heat, warm the oil and add the onions, garlic, herbs, and fennel.  Sprinkle lightly with salve, cover and cook, stirring occasionally for 8 to 10 minutes,
until the onions are softened and starting to brown.  While the onions cook, rinse and quarter the mushrooms 9about 3 cups).  

When onions are soft, stir in mushrooms and wine, cover and simmer for 5 minutes.   Stir in beans, tomatoes, and parsely, cover, and bring to a simmer.  
Cook for 10 minutes until hot and juicy, stirring occasionally.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
