## Pasta con Ceci

4 servings = ~30 minutes

* 1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling
* 4 medium garlic cloves, lightly crushed
* 1 tsp rosemary
* salt
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (usually omitted due to family preferences)
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1/2 cup dry white wine
* 2 15-oz cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 16 oz small tubular pasta, such as ditalini (originally called for 8 oz)
* 2 oz finely grated Pecorino Romano, plus extra for serving (optional)

1. Heat oil over medium heat until shimmering.
2. Add garlic and rosemary, season lightly with salt, and cook until garlic softens and turns golden, ~5 minutes.
3. Add pepper flakes (if using), stirring until fragrant, ~30 seconds.
4. Add tomato paste and cook until fragrant and brick red, ~1 minute.
5. Stir in wine, scraping up browned bits.
6. Bring to simmer and cook until wine emulsifies with olive oil and mixture reduces slightly, ~2 minutes.
7. Add ~1 cup chickpeas and ~1 cup broth and blend or mash until totally broken down.
8. Add remaining chickpeas, broth, black pepper, and salt to taste.
9. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
10. Stir in pasta and cook, stirring frequently, 1-2 minutes less than al dente.
11. Liquid should be between soupy and saucy, add liquid if needed, keeping in mind it will thicken as it cools.
12. Remove from heat, add cheese (if using) and stir rapidly to incorporate.
13. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
14. Serve with drizzled olive oil and extra grated cheese (if using).

* 1/2 cup uncooked ditalini (or other small shape) pasta

* I doubled pasta and added some MSG. Consider doubling, everything?

1. In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat olive oil until shimmering.
2. Add garlic, cook and stir until lightly brown and fragrant.
3. Add chickpeas, pasta, and boiling water.
4. Scrape up browned bits, lower heat, and simmer until pasta is cooked and most liquid has absorbed, ~15-20 minutes.
