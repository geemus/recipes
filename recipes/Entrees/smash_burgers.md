## Smash Burgers

4 servings = ~60 minutes

* 454g beef (1 lb)
* 15g egg yolk (1 yolk per lb of beef)
* 4.5g salt (per lb beef)
* 7g gelatin (per lb beef)

1. Add inclusions to beef and lightly mix, as close in timing to cooking as possible (30 minutes or less).
2. Cream and form patties. (minimize creaming if cooking in pan, medium creaming for sous vide, most creaming for grill ~5 squeezes)
3. Get griddle very hot.
4. Smash burger, parchment paper helps with this. Squish to about 1/4 inch thick and a little larger than your buns.
5. Cook until about 80% done (~2 minutes), then flip.
6. Add cheese and cook for another 30 seconds until cheese begins to give.
7. Serve.
