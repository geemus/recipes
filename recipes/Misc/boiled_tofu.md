## Boiled Tofu

- 750 milliliters water
- 1 tablespoon salt
- ½ teaspoon MSG (optional, but recommended)
- Firm tofu, cut into cubes or slabs depending on what you're cooking

**Method:**
1. Add the water, salt, and MSG to a medium saucepan and bring to a rolling boil.
2. Add the tofu to the boiling water, then reduce the heat to a low simmer.
3. Cook for 10–15 minutes.
   - Alternatively, mix boiling water, salt, MSG, and tofu in a heatproof bowl and let sit for 15–20 minutes.
4. Strain the water away from the tofu.
5. Lay the tofu pieces on a tea towel or kitchen roll (with space between each piece).
6. Either blot the moisture off the surface of the pieces or leave them for 20–30 minutes to steam dry.
   - Do not leave the tofu pieces to dry in a colander, as they may stick together.

This method firms up the tofu and prepares it for seasoning or further cooking.
