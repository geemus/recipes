## Classic Egg Salad Recipe from Skinnytaste

**Ingredients**
- 6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped
- 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped red onion
- 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Paprika, for garnish (optional)
- Chopped chives, for garnish (optional)[1]

## Instructions

- **Boil the eggs:** Cook the eggs until hard-boiled using your preferred method (stovetop, Instant Pot, or air fryer).
- **Cool and peel:** Run the cooked eggs under cold water, then peel them.
- **Chop the eggs:** Slice or dice the eggs to your desired consistency, either with an egg slicer or a knife.
- **Mix:** In a bowl, combine the chopped eggs with mayonnaise, red onion, salt, and pepper. Stir until well mixed.
- **Garnish:** Sprinkle with paprika and chives, if desired, for added color and flavor.
- **Serve:** Enjoy immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat[1].

## Additional Tips and Variations

- **Minimalist version:** For a three-ingredient egg salad, use just eggs, mayo, and salt[1].
- **Lower calories:** Swap some of the yolks for extra egg whites, or use light mayo or Greek yogurt instead of regular mayo[1].
- **Extra flavor:** Add pickle juice, diced pickles, capers, celery, Dijon mustard, or dry mustard powder.
- **Herbs and protein:** Incorporate fresh dill, parsley, or scallions. For more protein, add diced cooked shrimp or tuna[1].
- **Vegetables:** Mix in finely chopped celery or carrots for more texture and crunch[1].

This classic egg salad is simple, versatile, and easy to customize based on your preferences or what you have on hand[1].
