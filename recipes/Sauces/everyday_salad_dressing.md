## Everyday Salad Dressing

~1/3 cup = 5 minutes

* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 1 small garlic clove, pressed or minced (or 1/2 tsp garlic powder)
* 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice (or red wine vinegar)
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly-cracked black pepper

1. Combine ingredients: whisk in bowl, shake in jar, or pulse in blender.
2. Serve immediately, or refrigerate for up to one week (will need to remix to serve).
