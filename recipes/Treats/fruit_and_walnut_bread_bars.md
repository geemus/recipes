## Fruit and Walnut Bread Bars

32 bars = 45 minutes / 1 hour

* ~170 g plum, moist mixed dried fruit, such as crystallized ginger, papaya, cherries, pineapple, apricots, figs, etc in bite-size pieces (~ 1 cup)
* 136 g all-purpose flour (1 cup)
* 1 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 3 large egg whites, at room temp
* 1/4 tsp fine sea salt
* 100 g sugar (1/2 cup)
* 120 g walnuts, coarsely chopped (1 cup)

1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat to 350F.
2. Butter or spray an 8-inch square baking pan.
3. If fruit isn't moist, toss in bowl with very hot tap water to plump ~ 5 minutes, drain and pat dry.
4. Whisk flour and baking powder together.
5. In stand mixer with whisk, beat egg whites and salt to soft peaks.
6. Gradually beat in sugar and continue until peaks are firm and glossy.
7. Using sturdy flexible spatula, gently fold in flour mixture, followed by the walnuts and dried fruit.
8. Turn batter out into butter pan and use spatula to roughly smooth.
9. Bake 30-32 minutes, rotating after 15, or until bread feels set but has some give. Inserted tester should come away clean.
10. Bread will not brown, as it has no yolks or butter, but should be a warm ivory, like nougat.
11. Transfer pan to rack and rest ~ 5 minutes, then run table knife around, unmold and turn over to cool to room temp.
12. Cut into 32 bars, each about 1" x 2".
