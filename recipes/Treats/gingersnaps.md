## Gingersnaps

48 2-1/4" cookies = 25 minutes / 2 hours

* 200 g sugar (1 cup)
*  10 g baking soda (1 3/4 tsp)
*   3 g cinnamon (1/2 tsp)
*  20 g fresh ginger, finely grated (2 tbsp)
*  10 g ground ginger (2 tbsp)
*  15 ml vanilla extract (1 tbsp)
* a few cracks of black pepper
* 170 g unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks)
*  60 g sorghum or unsulphured molasses, not blackstrap (~1/4 cup)
*   1 large egg, cold
* 340 g whole wheat flour (2 1/2 cups)
* raw or granulated sugar for finishing

1. Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle position. Line two half sheet pans with parchment paper.
2. Combine sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, gingers, vanilla, pepper, butter and molasses in stand mixer.
3. Mix with paddle attachment on low to moisten, increasing to medium until fluffy, and pale tan, about 5 minutes.
4. Add egg, beating until smooth, ~2 minutes more, pausing to scrape as needed.
5. Resume mixing on low, sprinkle in flour, and continue until a soft dough is formed.
6. Divide into 48 1/2-oz portions with a 1 tbsp scoop.
7. Roll dough balls, tumble with finishing sugar, and arrange on sheet pans, leaving 2 inches in between. Do not flatten, cookies will spread.
8. Bake until puffed and chestnut brown, ~22 minutes.
9. Cool directly on pans 2 hours - prior to that, gingersnaps will not be crisp inside.
10. Store leftovers in an airtight container up to 3 weeks at room temperature.
