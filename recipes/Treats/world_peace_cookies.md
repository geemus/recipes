## World Peace Cookies

~36 cookies = 20 minutes / 3-4 hours

* 170 g all-purpose flour (1 1/4 cup)
*  28 g unsweetened cocoa powder (1/3 cup)
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 155 g unsalted butter (1 stick + 3 tbsp)
* 134 g packed light brown sugar (2/3 cup)
*  50 g sugar (1/4 cup)
* 1/2 tsp fleur de sel
*   1 tsp pure vanilla extract

4. Stop mixer, add all dry ingredients, and pulse until settled. Beat until dough forms big, moist curds.

6. Divide in half, and shape into 1 1/2 inch logs.
