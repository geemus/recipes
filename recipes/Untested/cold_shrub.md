## Cold Shrub

1-1/2 cups = ? minutes

* 1 cup red wine vinegar or apple-cider vinegar

1. Place berries or fruit in bowl. Cover with sugar and stir.

4. Add vinegar to syrup and whisk to combine.
5. Pour through funnel into clean bottle, cap and shake vigourously.
6. Date and store in refrigerator.
7. Check and shake periodically, after about a week sugar should dissolve entirely.
