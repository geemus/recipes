## Eggless Pancakes

2 medium or 4 small pancakes = ? minutes

* 1/2 cup Bisquick
* 2 tsp ground flaxseed
* 1 tsp wheat germ
* 1/2 cup 2% milk, plus more if needed
* 2 tbsp dark chocolate chips (optional)
* Salted butter, at room temp, for serving

1. Warm large nonstick pan over medium heat.
2. Combine Bisquick, flaxseed, and wheat germ in a measuring cup with a spout (for easy pouring).
3. Add milk, consistency should be thick but pourable.
4. Fold in chocolate chips (if using).
5. Pour batter into preheated pan in a large, round circle (or two smaller circles).
6. Once lots of bubbles form on the top and along the edges of the pancake, 2-5 minutes.
7. Use a wide spatula to flip it over and cook until underside is golden brown, 1-3 minutes.
8. Flip once more to ensure that both sides are golden brown.
9. Don't press down with spatula, as it will make it less fluffy!
10. Just before finished, spread some butter across the top, while still in pan, then transfer to plate.
11. Repeat with remaining batter. If it gets to thick while sitting, store in more milk until pourable again.
12. Serve warm, with more butter alongside.
