## Spicy Olive Tapenade

1-1/4 cups = ? minutes

* 10 oz froze or cooked lima beans (1-1/4 cups)
* 8 large fresh basil leaves
* 1 tsp kosher salt, plus more if needed
* 1 tsp freshly ground pepper
* 1 garlic clove, crushed
* 1/2 cup olive oil, plus more if needed

1. If using frozen lima beans, microwave for 5 minutes, until thawed and warmed. Let cool to room temperature.
2. Transfer lima beans to blender, add remaining ingredients, blend to chunky, hummus-like consistency. Scrape down sides periodically to ensure uniform blending. Add a few drops of olive oil if mixture gets too thick.
3. Taste and adjust lime juice and/or salt, if needed. Transfer to a serving bowl. Dip keeps, refrigerated for up to 1 week.
