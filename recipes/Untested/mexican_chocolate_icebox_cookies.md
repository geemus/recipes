## Mexican Chocolate Icebox Cookies

~ 4 dozen cookies = 35 minutes / 2 hours 35 minutes

* 1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup cocoa powder
* 3/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp cayenne
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 12 tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature
* 1 cup sugar
* 1-1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 egg

1. Sift together flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, cayenne, salt, and pepper in medium bowl.
2. In large bowl, cream together butter and sugar. Beat in vanilla and egg.
3. In mixer, gradually add dry mixture to butter mixture until uniform in color and no unmixed flour remains.
4. Using lightly floured hands, divide dough into two pieces and shape each into a log (~ 8 inches long).
5. Wrap tightly in wax paper or plastic wrap and freeze inside two tall drinking glasses on their sides (to prevent flattening on one side), for a minimum of 2 hours and up to 6 weeks.
6. When ready to use, preheat the oven to 375F.
7. Slice frozen dough in rounds (~1/4 inch thick), place on baking sheets, and bake 8-10 minutes.
8. Cookies are ready when they feel a bit firm at edges.
9. Store in airtight container when cool.
