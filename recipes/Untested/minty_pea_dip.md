## Minty Pea Dip

? servings = 10 minutes

* 1 cup frozen peas, thawed
* 2/3 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves, washed
* 2 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnishing
* juice from 1/2 lemon (about 1 tbsp)
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* salt to taste

1. In food processor, whirl all ingredients until it is the consistency of chunky guacamole.
2. Garnish with more shreaded Parmesan cheese and serve with baguette slices or spread on crusty bread.
Note: Don't make too far ahead, the mint will turn black if it sits too long.
