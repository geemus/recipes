## Sauce Gribiche

2-3 servings = ~30 minutes

* 4 tbsp olive oil, plus more for drizzling/serving
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
* 3 tbsp good tomato paste
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas (or 15-oz can, drained and rinsed)
* 1/2 cup uncooked ditalini (or other small shape) pasta
* 2 cups boiling water (room temp probably fine)
* crushed red pepper flaxes, for serving

* I doubled pasta and added some MSG. Consider doubling, everything?

1. In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat olive oil until shimmering.
2. Add garlic, cook and stir until lightly brown and fragrant.
3. Add chickpeas, pasta, and boiling water.
4. Scrape up browned bits, lower heat, and simmer until pasta is cooked and most liquid has absorbed, ~15-20 minutes.

5. (optional) Reduce starting oil to 2 tbsp. To serve: heat 2-3 tbsp olive oil in small pan, add clove garlic, tsp rosemary, pinch of salk and pepper flakes until sizzling, drizzle over pasta and eat.
