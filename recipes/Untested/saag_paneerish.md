4 servings = ? minutes

* 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp ghoo or olive oil, divided
* 2 tbsp coriander seeds
* 2 green cardamom pods, or 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
* 1 small yellow onion, diced into 1/2 inch pieces
* 1 tbsp roughly chopped fresh ginger
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 lb fresh baby spinach
* 1/2 tbsp fresh lime juice (from about a quarter of a lime), plus more as needed
* 1 small Indian green chile or serrano chile, roughly chopped
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 6 oz feta cheese, cut into 1/2-in cubes (a bit more than 1/2 cup)
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* 1/4 tsp asafetida (optional)
* 1/4 tsp red chile powder

1. Warm oil in large pan over medium heat.
2. Once shimmering, add coriander and cardamom; cook, stirring, ~ 2 minutes, until seeds start to brown.
3. Add onion and cook until translucent, 5-6 minutes.
4. Stir in ginger and garlic; cook for 1 minute more.
5. Add spinach and cook until just wilted, 4-5 minutes.
6. Remove pan from heat, add lime juice, green chile, and salt.
7. Let cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to blender and blend to chunky paste.
8. Return paste to same pan and set over low heat.
9. Stir in 1/2 cup water, then gently fold in feta, careful not to break cubes.
10. Cook for 5-7 minutes more to soften feta slightly and allow it to soak up some of the spinach sauce.
11. While feta cooks, in a small pan or butter warmer over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 2 tbsp ghee (or oil) for 1 minute.
12. Add cumin seeds, as soon as they begin to sputter and brown, about 1 minute max, remove from heat.
13. Immediately add asafetida (if using) and red chile powder to cumin oil.
14. Pour all of the ghee (or oil) mixture into the spinach and feta once that is done cooking.
15. Serve with rice or roti.
